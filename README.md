Pizza website host test

Browsers:
<ul>
  <li>Chrome-Working</li>
  <li>OperaGX-Working</li>
  <li>Firefox-Not Working</li>
</ul>

Things that need doing
<ul>
  <li>half-half layout needs work for selections on smaller devices</li>
  <li>basket (the non-iframe version isn't complete yet (would show pictures))</li>
  <li>implement duplicate order grouping</li>
</ul>

Things that broke on this publicily hosted version (at least on the website itself)
<ul>
  <li>The CSS for the builder isn't updating to account for small fix on description being hidden</li>
</ul>
